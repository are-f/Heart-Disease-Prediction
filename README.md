# Heart Disease Prediction

##  Overview
The **Heart Disease Prediction System** is a machine learningâ€“powered health risk classification solution designed to support early medical decision-making. It evaluates key clinical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and other medical factors to predict whether a patient may be at high risk of heart disease.

The model is built using **Logistic Regression**, chosen for its reliability in binary medical classification tasks. The trained model is deployed using a **Flask API** and accessible via a lightweight **HTML web interface** for real-time predictions.
